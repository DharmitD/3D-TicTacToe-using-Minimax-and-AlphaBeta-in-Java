# 3D TicTacToe using Minimax and AlphaBeta in Java
Created an AI system to play a 3D version of the basic tic-tac-toe game using a three-dimensional 4x4x4 playing board. The algorithms used are minimax and alpha-beta, with a custom heuristic value algorithm.
For an overview of the project and insights into the algorithm, it's implementation, results and inferences, refer to `report.html`. file.
For Java code, refer to `aiTicTacToe.java`.
